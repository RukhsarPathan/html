<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3> Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Rukhsar, and I am an aspiring front-end developer with a passion for technology and a strong foundation in web development.</h3>
<p>For the past seven years, I have worked in the financial services sector, where I honed my analytical skills and developed a keen understanding of client needs. While I enjoyed my time in finance, I often felt that something was missing. It was during this period that I began to reflect on my childhood interests—my fascination with technology, starting from the days of Pascal and Windows 98.</p>

<p>From an early age, I was captivated by the world of computers. I loved creating no-code websites and even launched my own Shopify store, where I learned valuable lessons about user experience and design. These experiences ignited a deeper interest in web development and software engineering, leading me to pursue my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Western Governors University (WGU).</p>

<p>At WGU, I have gained a solid foundation in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My education has equipped me with the skills to create engaging and responsive web applications. I thrive on the challenge of transforming complex problems into intuitive, user-friendly solutions.</p>
<p> In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy learning about entrepreneurship and the journeys of influential tech leaders. Their stories inspire me as I work on my side projects, where I can experiment and apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I am eager to launch my career as a front-end developer, where I can combine my technical abilities with my background in finance to create meaningful digital experiences. My goal is to eventually expand my expertise to full-stack development, allowing me to contribute to every aspect of web projects.</p>
<p> When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, diving into personal projects that fuel my creativity, or reading about the innovations shaping our world. I believe in lifelong learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow and improve.</p>
<p> Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I invite you to explore my work and connect with me as I embark on this exciting journey in the world of web development.</p>
